                <h3>5. Limitation of Liability</h3>

                <p><strong>1</strong> You expressly understand and agree that Max and its suppliers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses resulting from the use of or inability to use the service or our site. If you are not a paying customer, you also expressly understand and agree that Max and its suppliers will not be liable for any direct damages, including without limitation, any of the foregoing matters. Where any liability on our part has not been excluded by the foregoing, in no circumstance will the total amount of our liability exceed the aggregate amount that you have paid to us in the six (6) months preceding any alleged breach by us of this agreement or of any other applicable legal obligations.</p>

                <p><strong>2</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold us and (as applicable) our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, Max partners, officers, directors, agents, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms of Service or the documents it incorporates by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.</p>

                <p><strong>3</strong> Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis without any warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory.

                <p>We are not responsible if you break the law, breach this agreement or go against the rights of a third party, especially if you get sued. Service is &ldquo;as is&rdquo; so it may have errors or interruptions and we provide no warranties.</p>

                <h3>6. Waiver and Complete Agreement</h3>

                <p>The failure of Max to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Max and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Max (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</p>

                <p><strong>WHICH MEANS</strong> </p>

                <p>If Max chooses not to enforce any of these provisions at any time, it does not mean that they give up that right later. These terms of service make up the agreement that applies to you. This means that any previous agreements between you and Max don&rsquo;t apply if they conflict with these terms.</p>

                <h3>7. Intellectual Property and Customer Content</h3>

                <p><strong>1</strong> As between you and Max, Max is and will remain the exclusive unencumbered owner of the entire right including any Intellectual Property Rights in and to, the Service, as well as all software, systems and processes used in connection with the Service or its delivery. &ldquo;Intellectual Property Rights&rdquo; mean all worldwide intellectual or industrial property rights arising under statutory or common law or by contract (including any agreement, undertaking, understanding, arrangement, course of conduct or instrument) or treaty, now existing, subsisting or hereafter filed, issued, or acquired, including all: (a) patent rights and rights under patent applications; (b) copyrights, rights of or connected to authorship and moral rights, including copyright with respect to object code or source code; (c) rights relating to the protection of trade secrets, confidential information and know-how; (d) rights in trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade names, and design patent rights, and (e) any right similar, analogous, related or ancillary to the foregoing and any other proprietary rights relating to intangible property or that may be the subject matter of an application to protect or preserve any intangible property. (f) From time to time, users of our Service may have suggestions or input that could lead to changes in the Service. Max is and will remain the exclusive unencumbered owner of any feedback, suggestions, proposals, modifications, extensions, additions, enhancements or improvements (&ldquo;Enhancements&rdquo;) made by or in connection with a user relating to the Service or Max&rsquo;s provision or delivery of Services and you hereby irrevocably assign and transfer to Max all rights in and to all such Enhancements and hereby waive any moral rights you might otherwise have had with respect thereto. (g) You can remove your Max account at any time by deleting your Account. We reserve the right to continue to store and use the data you have uploaded after your account has been terminated, including data in respect of the amateur or professional athletes, whether in aggregate, anonymized or identifiable form, as well as to transfer the data to any third party company that acquires or becomes integrated with our business, whether through merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or other similar transaction or proceeding.</p>

                <p><strong>2</strong> By uploading Association or Franchise Account Content, you agree: (a) to allow other internet users to view your Association or Franchise Content; (b) to allow Max to display and store your Association or Franchise Content; and (c) that Max can, at any time, review all the Association or Franchise Content submitted by you to its Service.</p>

                <p><strong>3</strong> By making your account public, you agree to allow others to view your Association or Franchise Content.</p>

                <p><strong>4</strong> You are responsible for compliance of Association or Franchise Content with any applicable laws or regulations.</p>

                <p><strong>5</strong> We will not disclose your confidential information to third parties, except as required in the course of providing our services. Confidential information includes any materials or information provided by you to us which is not publicly known. Confidential information does not include information that: (a) was in the public domain at the time we received it; (b) comes into the public domain after we received it through no fault of ours; (c) we received from someone other than you without breach of our or their confidentiality obligations; or (d) we are required by law to disclose.</p>

                <p><strong>WHICH MEANS</strong> </p>

                <p>The IP associated with the Service remains ours. We respect your confidential information. You can terminate your account but we continue to have rights to store and use the data. If we are bought by another company, the data will get passed on to them.</p>

                <h3>8. Max Franchises Evaluators</h3>

                <p><strong>1</strong> Max Franchise Evaluators is an online directory of independent third parties (&ldquo;Franchises&rdquo;) that can help you conduct player evaluations using our service. Max does not employ Franchises and may not be affiliated with Franchises.</p>

                <p><strong>2</strong> Max does not endorse franchises and takes no responsibility for any work performed by franchises or failure to fulfill a work order. Links to websites of franchises, announcements about services or offers, and responses to email inquiries regarding franchises, are provided solely for informational purposes at the discretion of Max and shall not be construed or imply permission, or an affiliation, position regarding any issue in controversy, authentication, appraisal, sponsorship, nor a recommendation or endorsement of any website, product, service, activity, business, organization, or person, and any offers, products, services, statements, opinions, content or information on any linked third-party website.</p>

                <p><strong>3</strong> Under no circumstances shall Max be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary or other damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary or other damages that result from any contractual relationship between you and the franchise. These limitations shall apply even if Max has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitations shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

                <p><strong>WHICH MEANS</strong> </p>

                <p>Franchises are not employees of Max and we are not responsible for them.</p>

                <h3>9. Payment of Fees</h3>

                <p><strong>1</strong> For Association and Franchise account holders the service will be billed annually. When your billing period is over, the Account Owner will be sent an invoice via the email provided. As well, an invoice will appear on the Account page of your Max administration console.</p>

                <p><strong>2</strong> For all other users and account holders, the products and services purchased will be billed at the time or purchase to your credit card.</p>

                <p><strong>3</strong> All account holders have 10 business days to bring up and settle any issues with billing.</p>

                <p><strong>4</strong> All fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees or charges now in force or enacted in the future (&ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;).</p>

                <p><strong>5</strong> If you are a resident of Canada, you are responsible for all applicable Taxes that arise from or as a result of your subscription to or purchase of Max&rsquo;s products and services. These Taxes are based on the rates applicable to the Canadian billing address you provide to us. Such amounts are in addition to fees for such products and services and will be billed to the credit card you use to pay for the products and services. If you are exempt from payment of such Taxes, you must provide us with an original certificate that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to tax-exempt status. Tax exemption will only apply from and after the date we receive such a certificate.</p>

                <p><strong>6</strong> If you are resident in the U.S., Taxes may apply to your account subscription and or to purchases of some or all of Max&rsquo;s products and services. Any applicable Taxes are based on the rates applicable to the U.S. billing address you provide to us, and will be calculated at the time of purchase of the applicable Taxable Offerings. Such amounts are in addition to fees for the Taxable Offerings and will be billed to the credit card you use to pay for the Taxable Offerings. If you are exempt from payment of such Taxes, you must provide us with an original certificate that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to tax-exempt status. Tax exemption will only apply from and after the date we receive such a certificate.</p>

                <p><strong>7</strong> If you are not a resident of Canada or the U.S., and not subject to Canadian Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) in respect of your subscription to or purchase of Max&rsquo;s products and services, you must provide us with a statement by email to accounting@maxea.ca stating that: (i) you are not a resident of Canada or the U.S.; (ii) you are not GST/HST registered; and (iii) to the extent that you are an individual and not a corporation or other legal entity, you were not physically present in Canada when Max&rsquo;s products and services were made available to you. The statement should also include your complete home and/or business location address. If you do not provide such information, you will be charged for Taxes applicable to your subscription to or purchase of Max&rsquo;s products and services, which will be billed to your credit card until after such time that you provide us with the information described above. To the extent that you are an individual and not a corporation or other legal entity, and your location of usage changes to a place in Canada or the U.S., you must advise us immediately by email to accounting@maxea.ca.</p>

                <p><strong>8</strong> Max does not provide refunds.</p>

                <p><strong>WHICH MEANS</strong> </p>

                <p>For live payment gateways, a valid credit card is required. Associations and or Franchises will be billed every 365 days and have 2 weeks to pay. If you&rsquo;re exempt from Canadian or U.S. taxes, let us know by giving us your original exemption certificate and we&rsquo;ll stop adding taxes to your bill. No refunds.</p>

                <h3>12. Cancellation and Termination</h3>

                <p><strong>1</strong> You may cancel your Account at anytime by emailing support@maxea.ca and then following the specific instructions indicated to you in Max&rsquo;s response.</p>

                <p><strong>2</strong> Upon termination of the Services by either party for any reason:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Max will cease providing you with the Services and you will no longer be able to access your Account;</li>
                    <li>unless otherwise provided in the Terms of Service, you will not be entitled to any refunds of any fees, pro rata or otherwise;</li>
                    <li>any outstanding balance owed to Max for your use of the Services through the effective date of such termination will immediately become due and payable in full; and</li>
                    <li>your Association or Franchise page will be taken offline.</li>
                </ol>
