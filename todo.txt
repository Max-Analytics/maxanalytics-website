 - Data ownership / access

Ideas:
- Limit the number of user accounts
- Limit the number of evaluations
- Restrict user permissions
- Accountability tracking (i.e. this user changed this score)

 - Switch out player development and time saving
 - Data driven development
 	- Designing your programming to your players' needs
 	- Individual needs

  - Sport Engine
 	-> Two blog posts
